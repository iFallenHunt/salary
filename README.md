to calculate your salary with discount (Brazilian taxes)


'''
I ran into an error that I can't solve, on line 12 :
sbruto = htworked + hextra * (1 + (hovertime / 100)) * vhour
where the main calculation of the equation should happen, I get a return like this:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'type' and 'int'
'''
pull with solution accepted as long as it contains a description of what happened
